# CareerCompass 🧭  

## 📌 Overview  
**CareerCompass** is a Machine Learning + MERN project designed to help students explore and predict suitable career paths based on their **academic performance, course selection, and extracurricular activities**.  

The system uses **predictive analytics** with **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT)** models to analyze input data and suggest the most relevant career opportunities.  

This project aims to bridge the gap between **student potential** and **career guidance**, providing actionable insights for better decision-making.

## ✨ Features  
- ✅ Career Prediction based on academic & activity data  
- ✅ Integration of ML models (Random Forest, GBT)  
- ✅ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering for accurate insights  
- ✅ Performance Evaluation with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- ✅ Visualization of career trends  
- ✅ MERN stack integration for a **web-based career guidance system**  
- ✅ Scalable and extendable to real-world datasets
