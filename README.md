CareerCompass!🧭
📌 Overview

Navigating Career Path is a Machine Learning project designed to help students explore and predict suitable career paths based on their academic performance, course selection, and extracurricular activities.

The system uses predictive analytics with Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) models to analyze input data and suggest the most relevant career opportunities.

This project aims to bridge the gap between student potential and career guidance, providing actionable insights for better decision-making.
